<blockquote>
	<p>Welcome to UMBC’s Department of Information Systems and the new academic year. I am excited to share many of our recent developments with you below. We look forward to an exciting academic year where we continue our tradition of excellence. </p>     

<p>New Faculty: The department currently has 30 full-time faculty members, including four new tenure-track faculty members in the department. Dr. Sanjay Purushotham joined the IS department on August 2018. Dr. Purushotham received his PhD from the University of Southern California (USC) and held Postdoctoral Scholar positions in the Department of Computer Science and Integrated Media Systems Center (IMSC) at USC.  Dr. Purushotham’s current research involves developing novel deep learning models for data-driven analysis of healthcare time series data and building machine learning models for mathematical oncology. We are happy to have Dr. Purushotham on board.</p>

<p><strong>Student Outlook:</strong> We currently have over 1800 students across eight academic programs. With the help of our faculty members, students study, design, develop, and evaluate information technologies to address the needs of a broad range of individuals and organizations. This makes our students true problem solvers and ideal employees for public and private sector organizations with significant IT requirements. IT graduates continue to be among the most sought after professionals throughout government and industry sectors. Many of our PhD graduates find tenure track faculty positions at prestigious universities.</p>

<p>Student Graduation In the past academic year we graduated 305 undergraduate students, 159 Masters Students, and 9 PhD students many of whom are pursuing careers in the industry, government, and academia while others are pursuing graduate studies at the Masters and PhD levels.</p>

<p><strong>Faculty News:</strong> Many of our faculty members get recognition for contributions in their respective research areas. Just a few of examples this year: Dr. Nirmalya Roy received a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to advance his research on smart home technologies and wearable devices; Dr. Andrea Kleinsmith received a grant from NSF to study stress reflection in medical teams; Dr. Karunal Joshi is appointed site Director of the new NSF Center for Accelerated Realtime Analytics; Drs. Gangopadhyay, Chen and Karabatis has received a grant from the US Department of Education to support a number of PhD students in the area of Cybersecurity. Our faculty members are engaged in state-of-the-art research that has resulted in multiple new external grants in areas such as Health IT, Cybersecurity, Big Data/Data Science, Human Centered Computing, and Artificial Intelligence. You can view more of our research projects here.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Aryya Gangopadhyay, PhD</p>
Professor and Chair
Department of Information Systems, UMBC
